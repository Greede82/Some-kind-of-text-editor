This project is a Windows Forms application developed in C# using .NET Framework. It consists of several files, including the main form (`Form1.cs`), designer file (`Form1.Designer.cs`), resource file (`Form1.resx`), entry point (`Program.cs`), and configuration files (`App.config`, `lab4.csproj`, `lab4.sln`).

## Description

This application is a Windows Forms program for working with text. Its main features include:

- **Text Replacement:** Replace all occurrences of a specified pattern in the text with another string using regular expressions.
- **Palindrome Highlighting:** Find and highlight all palindromic words in the text.
- **Sentence Counting:** Count the number of sentences in the text (based on `.`, `!`, or `?`).
- **Sentence Capitalization:** Automatically capitalize the first letter of each sentence.
- **Arithmetic Expression Evaluation:** Calculate the result of an arithmetic expression entered in the text box.
- **Text Encoding/Decoding:** Encode or decode the text using a simple character-shifting algorithm.

All features are accessible through a graphical interface, making it easy to manipulate and analyze text.
